animation-direction:
	normal - The animation is played as normal (forwards). This is default
	reverse - The animation is played in reverse direction (backwards)
	alternate - The animation is played forwards first, then backwards
	alternate-reverse - The animation is played backwards first, then forwards

animation-timing-function:

	ease - Specifies an animation with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
	linear - Specifies an animation with the same speed from start to end
	ease-in - Specifies an animation with a slow start
	ease-out - Specifies an animation with a slow end
	ease-in-out - Specifies an animation with a slow start and end
	cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - Lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function

animation-fill-mode:
	none - Default value. Animation will not apply any styles to the element before or after it is executing
	forwards - The element will retain the style values that is set by the last keyframe (depends on animation-direction and animation-iteration-count)
	backwards - The element will get the style values that is set by the first keyframe (depends on animation-direction), and retain this during the animation-delay period
	both - The animation will follow the rules for both forwards and backwards, extending the animation properties in both directions
